# Gaalsien

This is a sample Torch project which is [live](https://space-engineers.com/server/184135/).

Originally created to present a [nice MOTD page](https://github.com/HnZGaming/Gaalsien/blob/master/Instance/motd.md) for the server but I figured to capitalize this opportunity and share all the config files too because as one of Torch contributors & community moderators, I know this will be a good point of reference for a lot of beginner admins & I seem to be one of very few (if any) who actively develop the program as well as host a live server.

- If you're just started on setting up your first Torch server, feel free to clone/download and edit this project so that you can jump-start on it.
- If you're an experienced Torch server admin, please feel free to suggest on any issues or improvements.

- I don't even know if this is gonna be an out-of-the-box experience; let me know if anything is not baked right.
