# Gaalsien

This is a sample Torch project which is [live](https://space-engineers.com/server/184135/).

Originally created to present a [nice MOTD page](https://github.com/HnZGaming/Gaalsien/blob/master/Instance/motd.md) for the server but I figured to capitalize this opportunity and share all the config files too because this will be a good point of reference for beginner admins & I'm one of few that wear both hats of a server admin & Torch developer.

- Feel free to clone/download and edit this project so that you can jump-start on your server's configuration.
- Let me know if things aren't working.
- If you're an experienced Torch server admin, please feel free to suggest on any issues or improvements.

## Important Notice

This server may be running some "experimental version" of mods that will crash the server if not replaced with the original mod.

## Disclaimer

- Some files may be gitignored due to security reasons.
- I won't be held responsible for any issues you may encounter running a copy of this project.
