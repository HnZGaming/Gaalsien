# Gaalsien

This is a sample Torch project which is [live](https://space-engineers.com/server/184135/).

Originally created to present a [nice MOTD page](https://github.com/HnZGaming/Gaalsien/blob/master/Instance/motd.md) for my server but I figured to capitalize this opportunity and share all the config files too as a good point of reference for fresh admins.

Owner/maintainer of this repo is one of Torch devs who generally enjoys pissing on other staffs as well as developing server health monitoring solutions like Profiler and Torch Monitor, which run on many of top servers if not all. This repo's server configuration is therefore equipped with those tools, limitation on players' activity will fall into the "strict" category and the live moderation is as toxic.

Most "gotcha's" in Torch server configuration is taken care of & you should be able to serve for up to 15 people on a fair machine as-is, that said you may get rid of the NPC mod which is a major cause of mini-freezes and you may loosen the block limit in exchange. You can also put limits on voxel-related features to cut even more variables out of your admin life.

- Feel free to fork/clone/download and edit this project so that you can jump-start on your server's configuration.
- Let me know if things aren't working out of the box.
- Suggest any improvements to receive virtual kisses and hugs.

## Important Notice

This server may be running some "experimental redistribution" of mods that will crash the server if not replaced with the original mod.

## Disclaimer

- Some files may be gitignored due to security reasons.
- I won't be held responsible for any issues you may encounter running a copy of this project.
