# TorchServer

Standard Torch server setup.

## Installation

This project uses VSCode to better navigate the mess of folders.

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode -e -h --accept-package-agreements
```

```powershell
code --install-extension ms-vscode.PowerShell
```

```powershell
code .
```

Press `F5` to launch the automatic restart script. Torch will boot up shortly and start downloading the SE dedi server, which may take some minutes. 

Upon GUI startup, close it. **WIP: Copying the default world to the Saves folder.**
